#### info...

In frontend if you use fetch you need include a credentials options or
the browser will send and error.
origin has beeen blocked by CORS. The value of the 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials' header in the response is ''
so we fix the problem by adding some credentials(check files in folders) 

Adding also options for cookies:
{ httpOnly: true, sameSite: 'None' secure: true }
